# Student Performance Analysis

This project aims to explore how various factors affect student performance, such as:

- **Gender**
- **Ethnicity**
- **Parental Level of Education**
- **Lunch Type**
- **Test Preparation Course Completion**

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to understand the correlation between these variables and student performance, to derive meaningful insights and assist in developing better educational strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- `Gender`: Student's gender (Male/Female).
- `Ethnicity`: Ethnic group to which the student belongs.
- `Parental Level of Education`: Highest educational qualification attained by the student's parents.
- `Lunch`: Type of lunch received by the student (standard/reduced).
- `Test Preparation Course`: Whether the student completed a test preparation course or not.

The target variable for this analysis is **student performance**, which could be measured in terms of exam scores in various subjects like Math, Reading, and Writing.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features if necessary.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing relationships between performance and factors like gender, ethnicity, parental education, etc.
   
3. **Statistical Analysis**: 
   - Investigating the statistical significance of each variable in relation to student performance.
   
4. **Modeling**: 
   - Using machine learning models to predict student performance based on the identified factors.
   
## Findings

- How **gender** influences scores.
- The role of **ethnicity** in performance.
- Correlation between **parental education** and student success.
- Effect of **lunch type** on performance.
- Impact of completing the **test preparation course** on student results.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of how various socio-demographic factors contribute to student performance. By understanding these relationships, educators and policymakers can make data-driven decisions to improve education quality and fairness.
